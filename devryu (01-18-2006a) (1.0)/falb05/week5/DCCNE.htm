Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region
</H3>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2>
The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the
C300-25 performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing
years. We anticipate a stronger year in current year with the introduction of the 
C300-30 model - a great copier at a competitive price.
