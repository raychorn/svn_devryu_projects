Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region

The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of
both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster
sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off 
into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest
region.
