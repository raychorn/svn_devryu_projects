<FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE=2>
Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight
downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under
sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25
unit which increased as last year progressed.
