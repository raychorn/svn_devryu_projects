		   <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome</H2>
		   <P>
		   <IMG SRC="Adams.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>Welcome to the Dunston Retreat Center. 
		   Whether you are planning to attend one of our many conferences or 
		   embarking on a private retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.</P>
		   <P>Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat Center 
		   provides comfortable and attractive accommodations while you enjoy the 
		   rustic setting available just outside your door. The Retreat Center has 
		   32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and kitchen facilities. If you 
		   want to get out, there are ample opportunities for hiking, canoeing and 
		   horseback riding in the surrounding area.</P>
		   <P>Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to accommodate 
		   the needs of various groups. We offer retreats for men, for women, and for 
		   couples. Please call about special needs retreats.</P>
		   <P>If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The 
		   retreat includes a time of daily sharing and guidance by a retreat 
		   director to supplement your private time of solitude and meditation.</P>
		   <P>At the Dunston Retreat Center we make everything as easy as possible, 
		   providing meals, towels, bedding - everything you need. Just bring 
		   yourself.
		   </P>

				         <H3 ALIGN=CENTER>A letter from one of our guests</H3>
				         I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat
				         at Dunston. I came to your center haggard and worn out
				         from a long illness and job difficulties. I left totally
				         refreshed. I especially want to thank Father Thomas
				         Holloway for his support.</P>
				         <P>I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful
				         place you have. Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat.
				         Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will become
				         a yearly event for me.</P>
				         <P>Sincerely,</P>
				         <P>Doris Patterson</P>
