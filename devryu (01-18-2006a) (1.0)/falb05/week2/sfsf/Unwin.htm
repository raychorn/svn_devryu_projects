<P>
<P><B>Name:</B>&nbsp; Jeffrey Unwin<BR><B>Age:</B>&nbsp; 
37<BR><B>Occupation:</B>&nbsp; Author and Critic<BR><B>Favorite Fish:</B>&nbsp; 
Squid<BR><B>Comments:</B>&nbsp; I look forward to SFSF and seeing all my old 
California friends again.<BR>Jeffrey is the hometown boy who made good. He's a 
noted author and critic now, but still has time to mingle with the commoners. 
Seriously, we're happy to have Jeffrey back again. We understand that he'll be 
reading selections of his novel, <I>Before the Fall</I>, and then afterwards 
he'll don his critic's hat and explain to us why it's so good.
