<a name="SALES"></a><H1>ScanMaster Sales: Tremendous</H1>
<P><I>Submitted by David Foster</I></P>
<P>The ScanMaster is clearly one of the big success stories of the industry. By 
creating a high-quality flatbed scanner targeted at the small business owner, 
we're succeeding in expanding the market for our scanner products. Based on 
sales from the first two quarters of the year, we've captured about 31% of our 
targeted flatbed scanner market. This makes four consecutive quarters that 
Jackson Electronics scanners have outsold their Photometric counterparts. Right 
now, we can proudly say that Jackson Electronics is the largest supplier of low 
to mid-cost scanners in the industry.</P><IMG

<P>The future looks bright. We estimate that ScanMaster sales will continue to 
grow through the final two quarters of the year. As sales of the ScanMaster 
continue to grow, we anticipate that there will be increasingly less demand for 
the Scan 100 series desktop scanner. By the end of the year we anticipate that 
90% of our desktop sales will be for the ScanMaster series. Based upon our 
projections, we calculate that Jackson Electronics will have shipped 57,000 
units by the end of year.</P>

<P><I>Submitted by Meg Childress</I></P>
<P>This year, Jackson Electronics unveiled the new ScanMaster scanner. We've 
designed this scanner as an inexpensive solution for small business owners to 
take advantage of desktop scanning. The scanner retails for $574.95, which makes 
it easily the most affordable desktop scanner in its class. All sales reps 
should familiarize themselves with the product description:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The ScanMaster color/grayscale scanner is an affordable flatbed scanner 
  that's quick and easy to use. You can scan color images, grayscale drawings, 
  and text in a single pass. Single-pass scanning saves you time over 
  multiple-pass desktop scanners. User-friendly software is included so that you 
  can learn how to scan in minutes. 
  <LI>The ScanMaster is ideal for creating new documents, converting existing 
  documents, and capturing images and pictures to be used in high-quality 
  presentations, pamphlets, and newsletters. It's ideal for desktop publishing, 
  word processing, and presentation graphics. Use the ScanMaster in conjunction 
  with your faxing and e-mail too. 
  <LI>Best of all, the ScanMaster is backed by Jackson Electronics' rock-solid 
  reputation for quality and reliability, so you know it's built to last. Plus 
  it comes with a one-year warranty and a responsive service and support plan to 
  keep you up and running. 
  <LI>The ScanMaster scanner is affordable, easy-to-use, and built to last. This 
  product is your small business scanning solution. </LI></UL>
<P>The ScanMaster has received favorable reviews in all major publications, 
including <I>PC Digest</I>, <I>Computer Views</I> and <I>Windows Today</I>. It 
has received a Best Buy award from <I>CPU Quarterly</I>.</P>
<a name="PLAN"></a><H1>ScanMaster Marketing Plan</H1>
<P><I>Submitted by Yusef Brown</I></P>
<P>The marketing plan for the ScanMaster scanner emphasizes its unique position 
in the industry: it provides a high-quality flatbed scanner at an affordable 
price. We are targeting primarily small business owners and home users. Combined 
with Jackson Electronics' less expensive handheld scanner, ScanBoy, and the more 
expensive flatbed scanner, UltraScan, Jackson Electronics has supplied key 
products for much of the scanning market.</P>
<P>ScanMaster's competition comes primarily from Photometric's 5SL Scanner and 
Bronson Peripheral's Image Maker 5000. Both are retailing for about $75 to $125 
more than the ScanMaster. However, we anticipate that both companies will close 
the gap later in the year with the introduction of new products.</P>
<P>We are increasing the value of the ScanMaster by including some very useful 
software with the product. Bundled software includes: WordScan, one of the more 
powerful OCR software packages, ScanFile, which organizes scanned images, and 
Image Plus!, a powerful graphics program.</P>
<P>ScanMaster was introduced last August at the popular DTPEX convention in Las 
Vegas, where it won rave reviews. Our sales reps are continuing to make 
presentations at the important trade shows. ScanMaster will be heavily promoted 
at the NextComp trade show in Memphis.</P>
